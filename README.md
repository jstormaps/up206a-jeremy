## Profile

I grew up outside Boston and attended college in the midwest before moving to SF, where I have lived the past ~2.5 years.  My experience pre-MURP involved paralegal work on projects advancing workers' protections against sexual harassment in the fast food industry and employment misclassification among rideshare drivers.

## Project Ideas

I found Prof. Millard-Ball's scholarship on quantifying sprawl and the land value of restrictively zoned parcels exciting.  I'm broadly interested in further exploring these veins of research, using spatial analysis to reveal the "hidden" economic dynamics resulting from land use policy.  Off-the-cuff, I'd be potentially interested in trying to map the costs of...
  * rebuilding in disaster-prone areas
  * heat-related illness in neighborhoods by tree coverage
  * insurance companies' move to reassess property values in light of climate risk
  * (I will try to further update this list as I continue brainstorming)

## Course Objectives

Since I will only be at UCLA for one year before continuing on to Sciences Po for the dual degree program, I am anxious to pick up as many skills as I can.  I don't have any background in coding and only minimal experience with GIS, so I'm hoping that between this course and perhaps the spring urban data science class, I'm able to put together compelling spatial analyses.
