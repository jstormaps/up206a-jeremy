# LA County Fire Risk and Poverty

## These two csv files contain data mapping fire hazard severity zones and poverty in LA county.  I could use these to begin establishing the relationship between geographic situation to fire risk and income/wealth.  There may be some interesting results as in LA county there are wealthy areas proximate to woods as well as poorer "exurban" like areas.
